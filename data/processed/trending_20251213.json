      "title": "Winnipeg homeless support groups struggling to find housing as more encampments are cleared out",
      "selftext": "Community organizations are asking the City of Winnipeg to rethink its new encampment restrictions due to the limited availability of permanent housing. The Mostyn Park encampment in West Broadway was [cleared out by city crews Wednesday](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/mostyn-park-encampment-remediated-9.7011231), prompting organizations like Main Street Project and the West Central Women’s Resource Centre to scramble to find housing for a handful of homeless people. Other encampments, including ones at Pacific Avenue and Ellen Street, and on Empress Street near Omand’s Creek, have been [cleared away](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-encampments-restrictions-begin-9.6983989)since the rules were put in place by the city last month. People are not permitted to remain in encampments during daylight hours, and they are prohibited within 50 metres of schools, daycares, playgrounds and skating rinks. Encampments are also not allowed within 30 metres of transit shelters, docks, bridges and some public facilities. The Main Street Project, which works with the city to find housing for people in encampments, is still trying to figure out how to best assist people forced to leave behind makeshift tents and belongings. Jamil Mahmood, the project’s executive director, says in the case of Mostyn Park, there was no housing available, and his team was forced to find temporary beds because the city put up no trespassing signs. “Right now, there's no available housing for us to access. So we're kind of left trying to figure out a shelter option as a short-term kind of gap filler,” he said Friday. “We're not getting the housing that we need to be able to offer people good housing so they have a place to move from an encampment.” He estimates seven people were able to get beds at the Salvation Army after Mostyn Park was cleared out, but some individuals have already left the shelter, opting to go to another encampment or seek other arrangements. Mahmood says that’s a major concern. “We don't know where they are, aren't able to provide them with resources and services, or support them. So that creates some challenges,” he said. On top of that, winter has arrived, so finding temporary shelters is already difficult. # 'Violation of people's human rights' Lorie English, is the executive director at the West Central Women’s Resource Centre. Like Mahmood, she says the city’s new policy on encampments has put her organization in an “awkward” position. “It's really making our work much more difficult when we're trying to connect and build relationships with people, build trust so that they trust us to move them into supportive housing,” English said. “Now we're in a position where every day we don't know where they might be the next day because encampments are being taken down before we've had an opportunity to make an offer of housing.” English says the women’s centre, which opened in August and is funded by the province, has transitioned just over 60 people into adequate housing through the province's homelessness strategy. She considers the city’s stance on encampments “quite restrictive,” particularly for females and gender-diverse persons. “We need to respect the fact that people have the human right to exist wherever they can, and quite frankly, we feel like the encampment ban is a violation of people's human rights,” English said. She would like to see enhanced communication between the city, province and the community to find a way forward where everybody’s needs can be met. “We also need to recognize that if we make the work that's already complicated even more complicated, it will take us even longer to house the folks that are currently living unsheltered,” English said. * [Outreach organization questions effectiveness, legality of Winnipeg's proposed encampment rules](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/homeless-encampment-bylaw-winnipeg-city-council-1.7630806) * [City of Winnipeg committee backs restricting tent camps as advocates call for managed encampment](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-encampment-restrictions-9.6967042) She emphasized that housing supports need to be in place before individuals are banned from encampments, otherwise “we're really just chasing the problem around the city rather than actually solving the problem.” CBC asked the city how many people have been relocated since the new rules were put in place and whether they were put into permanent housing, but the city hasn’t provided any specific information.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have a 1.5 year old goldendoodle who up until recently has been fairly well behaved and allowed to free roam the house while my husband and I are at work. We crated her as a puppy (stopped crating at around 10 months old) and honestly she was just never a big fan of the crate. When I tell you we tried every single thing to get her to like her crate…we did it all. Crate games, high value rewards in the crate (frozen stuffed Kong, licky mat, bully stick, etc), slowly building up the time spent in the crate, covering the crate, music on while we were gone, showering her with praise anything she went near the crate. You name it, we probably did it. She would tolerate being in there for maybe about an hour, and then it was non stop barking, crying, and just overall distress until we came home. Anyways we stopped crating her at around 10 months old and were shocked with how much more relaxed she seemed and how non-destructive she was. She would pretty much just lay on the couch and sleep the whole time we were gone. Up until now. Recently she has been a menace when left home alone. Ate my husband’s tennis shoes, stole a book off a table and shredded it, destroyed a wicker basket, but the cherry on top was her destroying about 5 ornaments PLUS the string lights on the Christmas tree. That really freaked me out, because I would never forgive myself if she got into something and really hurt herself/needed surgery/etc. So now I’m struggling with whether or not to start crating her again after all this time. My husband and I work rotating hours, so the longest she would be in the crate would be about 9 hours with a dog walker coming for a 30 min mid morning break. Some days would be shorter than that. I hate to do it, because she really never came around to liking her crate, but what if she gets hurt because she eats something harmful? We have tried to dog proof the house as much as possible, but every time I think there can’t possibly be anything she could get to, she manages to find something and chew it up. Sorry for the long post. If anyone actually read the whole things and has any advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "I had the pleasure of meeting Elvira at the PetValu on 11th Avenue SW. She was really sweet, curious, playful, and gentle and has been at the store for abouy two weeks now. Which is a surprise that she hasn't been adopted out already given how lovely she is. I believe she is about 1 year and six months old and still rather petite. They'll keep her for about another two weeks before she goes back into foster care. What really stood out about her was just how sweet and outgoing she was and yet so curious and gentle. You can tell she's really looking to make a connection with the right person, or family. She has a really interesting coloration which I believe is a form of chimerism seen in how her face splits into a different coloration. All that really means is that she likely has two different sets of DNA, and no associated health complications that I know of. It really makes her look rather striking and photogenic. If you're interested in adopting her she's located at the PetValu on 11th Avenue SW Calgary. I believe her adoption fee is $175 of I'm not mistaken. Even if Elvira isn't the animal for you I know local shelters and foster homes are overfilled who would be overjoyed to have people come look, and consider adoption, or fostering. Between pet abandonment after covid, increased living costs, renters making it difficult for pet owners, and the wild fires there is an overwhelming need for people to foster or open their home up to a new family member. If its not possible to accept a new member into your home, even just sharing and letting others you know aware of not just Elvira, but other shelters could make a huge impact. There are so many other ways to get involved too. Donations to local shelters, volunteer time, and just being active on their social pages is an amazing way to make an impact in your community. Regardless thank you for reading, and hopefully this gets to the right person looking for a new family member. 💕",

      "selftext": "Edit: thanks so much everyone for all the suggestions, you’ve given me a bunch to try that I hadn’t considered so we’ll give those a go :) So we’ve recently brought home a lab puppy who is now 10 weeks old. He’s such a great dog and already a big addition to the family, however the biting is… tiring… to say the least. I’m sure this has been asked 1000 times on here and will be a lot more in future, but I’m hoping for any advice or tips. So far the training with everything else is going great, he’s picking stuff up real quick. The biting though? Everything that I’ve read is meant to stop the biting, just excites him and makes him bite more. I’m trying not to put him in his crate too much as a direct result of the biting, as there’s the whole ‘don’t make them see the crate as punishment’ which I fully understand, but when he’s going feral it often feels like the only option we have left. All the other things I can seem to find, just seems to encourage him to bite more. Does anyone have any hints or ways they tried with their pups that surprisingly worked? To add to this, I know pups bite and they bite a lot. It does feel like we just have to wait this one out. Our last pup (over 20 years ago now) seemed to drop the biting within a couple of days via the yelping technique; something this lil guy seems to take as a ‘take it to the next level now, buddy’ command. Thank you in advance for any advice :)",

Most items requested aren't dirt cheap, but are still somewhat affordable on a decent income, like a jellycat stuffy, a crock pot, slippers and a cuddly blanket. There are a few pricier asks, like an electric guitar or a laptop, but I tend to assume the best of people and who knows? Maybe someone has something gently used they could give.

      "selftext": "After a lifetime of owning dogs I find myself dog-less. I lost my German Shepherd a little over a year ago, and my faithful mutt about 6 weeks ago. Life seems very empty and gray. Because of my age and health I don't feel good about getting a young dog. It wouldn't be fair to the dog, and as it would probably outlive me, be fair to my family. I've been looking for a senior dog to give it the best last few years of its life but discovered they don't come along very often. I stumbled on a 5 year old Springer Spaniel that ticks all the marks. Laid back, easy going, happy with a comfy bed, good on a leash, knows his basic commands and gets along with other dogs, cats and people. I think I'm going to go for it. I'm still physically able to walk him a couple of times a day. And 5 or 6 times a week I'm able to take him to a rural area for some off leash fun (depending on his recall) as I have done for the past twenty years with my other dogs. This will be my first time adopting an older, used, pre-owned dog. :). I'm onboard with the 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months concept. Any other advice for an older guy adopting an older dog. This will be a first for me and your thoughts would be appreciated.",

      "selftext": "For context: I am a cegep student living in Dorval and I go to Marianopolis. I have my license but no car, for now at least, therefore I rely on the STM. I find it almost impossible to be time efficient when taking the bus, having to take countless connections to get anywhere, whether it be my gym, Mari, or downtown. I have direct bus routes to Fairview or the Dorval Terminus, but there's nothing in between. Getting to a 211/411/425 stop is a 20 minute walk from my home and the Terminus/train station is almost a one hour walk. Bus schedules are incredibly inconsistent at my nearest stops (202/203/209), often having a sort of 10 minute window which they show up in. Sometimes they show up earlier than announced, making me miss them, and sometimes they show up so late I can't catch my connections anywhere, having to wait another 30 minutes for another bus. Not only that but if I miss any of my initial buses, I sometimes have to wait up to 45 minutes for another bus. I really am looking forward to the Anse-à-l'Orme &amp; YUL branches of the REM opening, however I don't even know what to expect anymore considering they keep delaying them + I still need to take a bus for 10-15 minutes before getting to a station. And the train is nice and all in rush hour but its schedule only works for me like twice per week, and once again, I have to take the bus to get to the stations. I really am starting to hate living in West Island and other than buying myself a car, I can't really see any other stable option. Does anyone have similar experiences and has found solutions to this issue?",

When the weather is mild, she handles walks as long as 4 miles fine - comes home and still has plenty of energy. Lately, I've been trying to play fetch and tug but she's seeming to get bored of it and goes to lay down. She learns tricks quickly though, so I've been trying to think of other things to do to keep her active when it's 8 degrees or 100 degrees out. When I look into agility training I see big open facilities or outdoor setups. Any recommendations for indoor exercise or has anyone done agility training in the smaller space of a house with a small dog? We both want to go for longer walks, but it doesn't feel safe this winter so far. The last few winters were relatively mild so this hasn't been much of an issue.",

In fact, that just makes her more determined, and I end up chasing her around the house. I’ve tried everything. We walk at least an hour every day. We do little 10-minute sniff walks too. I use snuffle mats, Kong, pupsicles, etc., to keep her occupied. There are gates all over the place to keep her out of certain areas. She does a 2-hour nap in her crate once a day. But we always end up in the same place. I can’t do just 2 hours a day of me time. I work full time from home and have chores, etc., like anyone else. Will this improve as she gets older?

He's 7 months next week and wanted to give an update. I no longer hate him! I actually love him (don't always like him, can be very tiring) we got a crate and it didn't really go well, he seems to be more anxious with restricted space. Click training was a lifesaver for us, he is quick on learning! We've been working on 'door is a bore' which is generally going well, still good days and bad days. He's very much learning to chill in his own independence which is lovely to see. He's up to about 50 minutes alone with the 5 minute training and increments, and he's been going to doggy daycare which he loves and has honestly saved us as gives us a break to run our errands and he's knackered afterwards. He's a cuddle bug when he wants to be. He sleeps through until about 5 when he jumps on the bed and wants a cuddle (we let him sleep with us the first night, our own fault). One thing is, he's an incredibly intelligent dog (our greyhound baby was a himbo). He finds treats in a second, puzzle feeders no issue. I do high reward in loo roll and loads of other stuff but would love any other household enrichment ideas! Thank you all for all the support and letting me rant! The light is at the end of the tunnel and seeing others frustrated too helped me feel seen and it will get easier!",

I’m doing his care alone which is mostly fine but I’m finding it hard to make time for myself, when he naps I have a million and one things to do related to him.

      "selftext": "I am posting this to help other fur parents. MetLife Pet Insurance has been the most frustrating and unprofessional insurance experience I’ve ever had as of recent. I’ve been a paying customer for years. My premium increased from $145/month to $170/month this year and I’m now paying over $2,000 a year for coverage that they refuse to honor. I submitted a claim for my dog's newly diagnosed allergies. MetLife denied it as a “pre-existing condition,” even though: She had no prior allergy symptoms (no itching, no ear infections, no skin issues). No veterinarian ever suspected allergies until the dermatology appointment on 11/21/25. The symptoms MetLife used to justify the denial were unrelated GI issues (intermittent diarrhea), which have nothing to do with skin/ear allergies. When I sent a formal written appeal with complete SOAP notes and specialist documentation, MetLife didn’t even process it as an appeal — they simply misfiled it as a new claim and denied it again without reviewing anything. When I called to fix it, I was told the only way forward was to make my veterinarians fill out yet another MetLife form, despite the fact that the records already prove the denial was based on a misinterpretation of their own policy. This came from an individual who constantly interrupted me and spoke over me. In short: They denied a legitimate claim by stretching the definition of “pre-existing” beyond anything medically reasonable. They ignored a written appeal entirely. They pushed the burden back onto already overworked veterinarians. They’re collecting $170/month while refusing to honor coverage. If you’re considering MetLife Pet Insurance, be prepared for denials, misrouted appeals, and a company that seems far more invested in avoiding payouts than supporting pet owners. I would strongly warn anyone against trusting them with your pet’s care.",

At 4 months, she was still unpredictable but stopped going in the house very often, maybe once in a while. She had to be watched 24/7. At 5 months, if she’s playing she asked to go out every 30 min-1 1/2 hours. If she’s sleeping she asked every 3-4 hours. Now at 6 months, she can hold it for 5 hours even with playing and hanging around. My advice: be diligent about potty training!! if they have an accident, pick them up mid accident and take them outside. Go through the same door every time. Use a bell and high value treats they only get when going potty. Nature will take its course and their tiny bladders will be able to hold it more!",
