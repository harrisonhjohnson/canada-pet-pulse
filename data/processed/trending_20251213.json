      "title": "Has anyone in an Ottawa apartment the last few years used a small deep freezer? How much more is hydro?",
      "selftext": "Context: I live in a 500 sq ft 1 bedroom in the Byward and I am seriously considering getting a small deep freezer. Money is tight for all of us, I’m not excluded, and I’m wondering if grocery costs for me to get extra freezer space for bulk meat and veggie purchases + added hydro would be less expensive (not just $, but my time and energy too) than weekly grocery runs. When I say “small” I mean like these little 3 ft ones (see below), but absolutely open to suggestions (hence the Looking For flair). I already pay out the absolute bootyhole in hydro ($150 to $250 per month…. So rude) and I’d be willing to invest in the monthly subscription of higher hydro bill if it’s not too outrageous. My thinking is this sub is best because because Ottawa hydro billing and downtown apartment setups make real usage costs pretty location-specific if you consider that billing structure + apartment realities + local rates make local experiences more useful than generic answers. I couldn’t think of a better place to ask people with the same or similar hydro providers and apartment setups! If anyone has any experience with small deep/chest freezers in apartments, please let me know. Many thanks!

      "title": "Winnipeg homeless support groups struggling to find housing as more encampments are cleared out",
      "selftext": "Community organizations are asking the City of Winnipeg to rethink its new encampment restrictions due to the limited availability of permanent housing. The Mostyn Park encampment in West Broadway was [cleared out by city crews Wednesday](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/mostyn-park-encampment-remediated-9.7011231), prompting organizations like Main Street Project and the West Central Women’s Resource Centre to scramble to find housing for a handful of homeless people. Other encampments, including ones at Pacific Avenue and Ellen Street, and on Empress Street near Omand’s Creek, have been [cleared away](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-encampments-restrictions-begin-9.6983989)since the rules were put in place by the city last month. People are not permitted to remain in encampments during daylight hours, and they are prohibited within 50 metres of schools, daycares, playgrounds and skating rinks. Encampments are also not allowed within 30 metres of transit shelters, docks, bridges and some public facilities. The Main Street Project, which works with the city to find housing for people in encampments, is still trying to figure out how to best assist people forced to leave behind makeshift tents and belongings. Jamil Mahmood, the project’s executive director, says in the case of Mostyn Park, there was no housing available, and his team was forced to find temporary beds because the city put up no trespassing signs. “Right now, there's no available housing for us to access. So we're kind of left trying to figure out a shelter option as a short-term kind of gap filler,” he said Friday. “We're not getting the housing that we need to be able to offer people good housing so they have a place to move from an encampment.” He estimates seven people were able to get beds at the Salvation Army after Mostyn Park was cleared out, but some individuals have already left the shelter, opting to go to another encampment or seek other arrangements. Mahmood says that’s a major concern. “We don't know where they are, aren't able to provide them with resources and services, or support them. So that creates some challenges,” he said. On top of that, winter has arrived, so finding temporary shelters is already difficult. # 'Violation of people's human rights' Lorie English, is the executive director at the West Central Women’s Resource Centre. Like Mahmood, she says the city’s new policy on encampments has put her organization in an “awkward” position. “It's really making our work much more difficult when we're trying to connect and build relationships with people, build trust so that they trust us to move them into supportive housing,” English said. “Now we're in a position where every day we don't know where they might be the next day because encampments are being taken down before we've had an opportunity to make an offer of housing.” English says the women’s centre, which opened in August and is funded by the province, has transitioned just over 60 people into adequate housing through the province's homelessness strategy. She considers the city’s stance on encampments “quite restrictive,” particularly for females and gender-diverse persons. “We need to respect the fact that people have the human right to exist wherever they can, and quite frankly, we feel like the encampment ban is a violation of people's human rights,” English said. She would like to see enhanced communication between the city, province and the community to find a way forward where everybody’s needs can be met. “We also need to recognize that if we make the work that's already complicated even more complicated, it will take us even longer to house the folks that are currently living unsheltered,” English said. * [Outreach organization questions effectiveness, legality of Winnipeg's proposed encampment rules](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/homeless-encampment-bylaw-winnipeg-city-council-1.7630806) * [City of Winnipeg committee backs restricting tent camps as advocates call for managed encampment](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-encampment-restrictions-9.6967042) She emphasized that housing supports need to be in place before individuals are banned from encampments, otherwise “we're really just chasing the problem around the city rather than actually solving the problem.” CBC asked the city how many people have been relocated since the new rules were put in place and whether they were put into permanent housing, but the city hasn’t provided any specific information.",

Someone hit my car parked on Marina Dr. in Chestermere, they went too fast on the turn and slipped into me. They came out to make sure I didn't have a camera and deliberately chose not to come to the door and inform me. Insurance says I have to pay since we don't know who did it, RCMP says they're going to close my case if I can't get the license plate (wtf is their job then??). This footage was given by a kind neighbour the night it happened when I realized my car was sideways and my bumper was cracked. I wanted footage to confirm that someone hit me, and now I'm my own constable but we're not here to talk about how useless the RCMP is. I'm pretty sure this is a Mercedes C300 coupe. They have substantial damage because their car pieces are in my trunk. If anyone recognizes this car, please DM me. If you'd rather not give me the information, here is the File #: 20251800254 you can call the RCMP directly. I am not in a position to pay these repairs out of pocket and I'm not impressed that the person decided to be a POS and not own up to their mistake. Thank you.",

It is ridiculous how many people use that bus lane and sail right through the turn off point in order to get ahead of everybody who patiently waits in the two thru-lanes. I’m sure some of my fellow Redditors will have a different opinion on this matter, but to those drivers who feel so entitled that they get to do this (whether at this intersection or others like it), may your Bluetooth connection forevermore only work when you don’t want it to.",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I have a 1.5 year old goldendoodle who up until recently has been fairly well behaved and allowed to free roam the house while my husband and I are at work. We crated her as a puppy (stopped crating at around 10 months old) and honestly she was just never a big fan of the crate. When I tell you we tried every single thing to get her to like her crate…we did it all. Crate games, high value rewards in the crate (frozen stuffed Kong, licky mat, bully stick, etc), slowly building up the time spent in the crate, covering the crate, music on while we were gone, showering her with praise anything she went near the crate. You name it, we probably did it. She would tolerate being in there for maybe about an hour, and then it was non stop barking, crying, and just overall distress until we came home. Anyways we stopped crating her at around 10 months old and were shocked with how much more relaxed she seemed and how non-destructive she was. She would pretty much just lay on the couch and sleep the whole time we were gone. Up until now. Recently she has been a menace when left home alone. Ate my husband’s tennis shoes, stole a book off a table and shredded it, destroyed a wicker basket, but the cherry on top was her destroying about 5 ornaments PLUS the string lights on the Christmas tree. That really freaked me out, because I would never forgive myself if she got into something and really hurt herself/needed surgery/etc. So now I’m struggling with whether or not to start crating her again after all this time. My husband and I work rotating hours, so the longest she would be in the crate would be about 9 hours with a dog walker coming for a 30 min mid morning break. Some days would be shorter than that. I hate to do it, because she really never came around to liking her crate, but what if she gets hurt because she eats something harmful? We have tried to dog proof the house as much as possible, but every time I think there can’t possibly be anything she could get to, she manages to find something and chew it up. Sorry for the long post. If anyone actually read the whole things and has any advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",

Ideally something relatively inexpensive, easy to show up to solo, and where it wouldn’t feel weird trying to meet people or join in. I’d love something that could turn into a regular thing rather than a one off. I’m open to classes, clubs, games, hobbies, or just chill social spaces where people actually talk. I don’t mind being new or bad at something, just trying to build a better routine and meet some new people. Would really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "I had the pleasure of meeting Elvira at the PetValu on 11th Avenue SW. She was really sweet, curious, playful, and gentle and has been at the store for abouy two weeks now. Which is a surprise that she hasn't been adopted out already given how lovely she is. I believe she is about 1 year and six months old and still rather petite. They'll keep her for about another two weeks before she goes back into foster care. What really stood out about her was just how sweet and outgoing she was and yet so curious and gentle. You can tell she's really looking to make a connection with the right person, or family. She has a really interesting coloration which I believe is a form of chimerism seen in how her face splits into a different coloration. All that really means is that she likely has two different sets of DNA, and no associated health complications that I know of. It really makes her look rather striking and photogenic. If you're interested in adopting her she's located at the PetValu on 11th Avenue SW Calgary. I believe her adoption fee is $175 of I'm not mistaken. Even if Elvira isn't the animal for you I know local shelters and foster homes are overfilled who would be overjoyed to have people come look, and consider adoption, or fostering. Between pet abandonment after covid, increased living costs, renters making it difficult for pet owners, and the wild fires there is an overwhelming need for people to foster or open their home up to a new family member. If its not possible to accept a new member into your home, even just sharing and letting others you know aware of not just Elvira, but other shelters could make a huge impact. There are so many other ways to get involved too. Donations to local shelters, volunteer time, and just being active on their social pages is an amazing way to make an impact in your community. Regardless thank you for reading, and hopefully this gets to the right person looking for a new family member. 💕",

      "selftext": "Edit: thanks so much everyone for all the suggestions, you’ve given me a bunch to try that I hadn’t considered so we’ll give those a go :) So we’ve recently brought home a lab puppy who is now 10 weeks old. He’s such a great dog and already a big addition to the family, however the biting is… tiring… to say the least. I’m sure this has been asked 1000 times on here and will be a lot more in future, but I’m hoping for any advice or tips. So far the training with everything else is going great, he’s picking stuff up real quick. The biting though? Everything that I’ve read is meant to stop the biting, just excites him and makes him bite more. I’m trying not to put him in his crate too much as a direct result of the biting, as there’s the whole ‘don’t make them see the crate as punishment’ which I fully understand, but when he’s going feral it often feels like the only option we have left. All the other things I can seem to find, just seems to encourage him to bite more. Does anyone have any hints or ways they tried with their pups that surprisingly worked? To add to this, I know pups bite and they bite a lot. It does feel like we just have to wait this one out. Our last pup (over 20 years ago now) seemed to drop the biting within a couple of days via the yelping technique; something this lil guy seems to take as a ‘take it to the next level now, buddy’ command. Thank you in advance for any advice :)",

The tree still has several angels up with mostly older kids and women asking for things, and I think the deadline will probably be coming soon. Most items requested aren't dirt cheap, but are still somewhat affordable on a decent income, like a jellycat stuffy, a crock pot, slippers and a cuddly blanket. There are a few pricier asks, like an electric guitar or a laptop, but I tend to assume the best of people and who knows? Maybe someone has something gently used they could give. Anyway, if you're feeling generous, it's a way to make Christmas a bit happier for someone who is probably going through a lot right now.",

      "selftext": "After a lifetime of owning dogs I find myself dog-less. I lost my German Shepherd a little over a year ago, and my faithful mutt about 6 weeks ago. Life seems very empty and gray. Because of my age and health I don't feel good about getting a young dog. It wouldn't be fair to the dog, and as it would probably outlive me, be fair to my family. I've been looking for a senior dog to give it the best last few years of its life but discovered they don't come along very often. I stumbled on a 5 year old Springer Spaniel that ticks all the marks. Laid back, easy going, happy with a comfy bed, good on a leash, knows his basic commands and gets along with other dogs, cats and people. I think I'm going to go for it. I'm still physically able to walk him a couple of times a day. And 5 or 6 times a week I'm able to take him to a rural area for some off leash fun (depending on his recall) as I have done for the past twenty years with my other dogs. This will be my first time adopting an older, used, pre-owned dog. :). I'm onboard with the 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months concept. Any other advice for an older guy adopting an older dog. This will be a first for me and your thoughts would be appreciated.",

She told me she lived on my street, then spun me a yarn about her recently deceased teen daughter who had been murdered \"just down the road\" by her classmates after coming out to them. Said they bashed her head in with a rock. She went on to say that because of her grief she hadn't been able to work, and that she was in danger of having her other kids taken from her if she couldn't prove she had food and other essentials at her home. Offered to shovel snow or do other miscellaneous work in exchange for 20 dollars. I presume she would have asked for the 20 bucks up front, pretended to get to work, then went off to find the next sucker the second I went inside. This happened near the intersection of Montreal road and Bathgate drive. She appeared to be in her mid sixties, white, thin build, gray hair just above her shoulders, with a small pointy nose.",

But I feel nervous now, that a treatment was done on the same floor in three units right next to each other across the floor. The way the floor is set up is that there's two elevator between my side of the floor and their units. There is also a unit directly across from them nearby that was not treated. I checked on the floors above and below those units and there was no notice of any treatment there. One thing I've noticed over the past month or so in my building is that in the afternoons/evenings it has frequently smelled like someone has been cooking very smelly Parmasean with vomit in it. Just reeks. It actually smells like it's stewing, like, as if it's heated. Does anyone have any idea what that could be? I can't help but think this stench and the pest situation is connected. I didn't complain about the smell bc it seemed like some kind of food someone was preparing and it never wafted into my unit. The building is pretty nice. It is likely older, but well kept and my unit is newly renovated. It's downtown. Anyway, just nervous that these pests might migrate, and I'm not sure why only a few units would be treated, if that's a good or a bad sign. If anyone has any insight or advice that would be appreciated, thanks",

I just drove past there about an hour ago - 95th just north of 111 Ave is (predictably) a skating rink. There was also a collision at 95th and 111, which affects the detour. So... lots going on.

The reason is because while he spins he steps on his poop and makes more of a mess while doing this. It really is starting to get me agitate because it is becoming more frequent that he poops inside and does a mess. Yes we do take him outside around 9pm-10pm before we go to sleep but it is still not enough. I don’t know if this has to do with us moving out and the dog not sleeping in the same room as me? But it started around the time we moved out (1 year ago)and started to become more frequent from there.",
