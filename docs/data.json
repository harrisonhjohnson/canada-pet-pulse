      "title": "Struggling with whether to crate my dog while at work",
      "selftext": "Hi all, I have a 1.5 year old goldendoodle who up until recently has been fairly well behaved and allowed to free roam the house while my husband and I are at work. We crated her as a puppy (stopped crating at around 10 months old) and honestly she was just never a big fan of the crate. When I tell you we tried every single thing to get her to like her crate…we did it all. Crate games, high value rewards in the crate (frozen stuffed Kong, licky mat, bully stick, etc), slowly building up the time spent in the crate, covering the crate, music on while we were gone, showering her with praise anything she went near the crate. You name it, we probably did it. She would tolerate being in there for maybe about an hour, and then it was non stop barking, crying, and just overall distress until we came home. Anyways we stopped crating her at around 10 months old and were shocked with how much more relaxed she seemed and how non-destructive she was. She would pretty much just lay on the couch and sleep the whole time we were gone. Up until now. Recently she has been a menace when left home alone. Ate my husband’s tennis shoes, stole a book off a table and shredded it, destroyed a wicker basket, but the cherry on top was her destroying about 5 ornaments PLUS the string lights on the Christmas tree. That really freaked me out, because I would never forgive myself if she got into something and really hurt herself/needed surgery/etc. So now I’m struggling with whether or not to start crating her again after all this time. My husband and I work rotating hours, so the longest she would be in the crate would be about 9 hours with a dog walker coming for a 30 min mid morning break. Some days would be shorter than that. I hate to do it, because she really never came around to liking her crate, but what if she gets hurt because she eats something harmful? We have tried to dog proof the house as much as possible, but every time I think there can’t possibly be anything she could get to, she manages to find something and chew it up. Sorry for the long post. If anyone actually read the whole things and has any advice I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "After a lifetime of owning dogs I find myself dog-less. I lost my German Shepherd a little over a year ago, and my faithful mutt about 6 weeks ago. Life seems very empty and gray. Because of my age and health I don't feel good about getting a young dog. It wouldn't be fair to the dog, and as it would probably outlive me, be fair to my family. I've been looking for a senior dog to give it the best last few years of its life but discovered they don't come along very often. I stumbled on a 5 year old Springer Spaniel that ticks all the marks. Laid back, easy going, happy with a comfy bed, good on a leash, knows his basic commands and gets along with other dogs, cats and people. I think I'm going to go for it. I'm still physically able to walk him a couple of times a day. And 5 or 6 times a week I'm able to take him to a rural area for some off leash fun (depending on his recall) as I have done for the past twenty years with my other dogs. This will be my first time adopting an older, used, pre-owned dog. :). I'm onboard with the 3 days, 3 weeks, 3 months concept. Any other advice for an older guy adopting an older dog. This will be a first for me and your thoughts would be appreciated.",

Tonight we could barely go anywhere because of all the snowbanks and she wanted to go into the grass but the snow is like half frozen and she struggled walking on it. When the weather is mild, she handles walks as long as 4 miles fine - comes home and still has plenty of energy. Lately, I've been trying to play fetch and tug but she's seeming to get bored of it and goes to lay down. She learns tricks quickly though, so I've been trying to think of other things to do to keep her active when it's 8 degrees or 100 degrees out. When I look into agility training I see big open facilities or outdoor setups. Any recommendations for indoor exercise or has anyone done agility training in the smaller space of a house with a small dog? We both want to go for longer walks, but it doesn't feel safe this winter so far. The last few winters were relatively mild so this hasn't been much of an issue.",

He goes out between 10-11pm and sleeps until around 6:30am Within the last week, he has been scratching and chewing at any bed or blanket in his crate. He’s completely destroyed 2 crate beds, and 3 blankets- so now all he gets is a folded large towel as I’m not going to let that pattern continue. He’s also now newly waking up at night around 1-2am whining since we removed the dog bed. The first time we let him out to potty and right back in his crate. Now it seems worse each night since where he is whining multiple times a night. I can’t tell if he’s whining because he’s uncomfortable with no comfy bed anymore, or if he is cold with not a lot of blankets, just wants company or if he truly does need to go out in the middle of the night now when he never has before? I don’t want to start the pattern of pottying at night if it’s not truly needed. Tonight at 2am he even pooped in his crate- which has never happened before. Didn’t appear to be abnormal or a GI issue. Happily climbed on the couch and slept while I cleaned it all up. It seems he’s doing everything he can to not sleep in his crate at night anymore. Sleeping on our bed is a hard no- and sleeping in our room on a dog bed I don’t think he’s trustworthy enough to do, as he still gets into things often. Crate is too large to bring up every night and we have no space in our room for it. Help?! I wake up with young kids every night as it is, with this happening I’m getting no sleep and I’m sure the puppy isn’t getting much. either!",
