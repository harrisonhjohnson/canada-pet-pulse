      "selftext": "✈️🐾 Become a Christmas Flight Angel! 🐾🎅🏻 We are urgently looking for WestJet flights leaving from Winnipeg with final destinations in Vancouver, Ottawa, Abbotsford, Kelowna, and Prince Edward Island. With the holiday flight embargo beginning December 18th, we are desperate for help! We have so many dogs and cats still needing to be flown to safety before Christmas. ❤️🎄 By becoming a Flight Angel, you can save a life simply by taking the trip you already have planned. We’ll pair a rescue dog or cat with your existing flight—all we need are your booking details. After confirmation, you’ll meet the animal and our team about 2 hours before departure, check in together, and then travel as usual. When you land, the receiving rescue will be there to welcome the animal to their new beginning. No extra cost. No extra travel. Just a small act of holiday kindness that makes a life-changing difference. 💙 Your seat could be their Christmas miracle. ✨ Fill out the form below to become a Flight Angel today! https://www.k9advocacymanitoba.ca/flight-angel",
